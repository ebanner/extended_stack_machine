This project entails me, Edward Banner, porting a stack-based machine emulator
written by Timothy V. Fossum from C++ to Java and building a GUI front end that
will allow the user to visually interact with a program during execution.  This
is my first experience ``porting" software, so this will most likely be an
entire rewrite due to my inexperience.  That being said, I will employ Dr.
Fossum's techniques in my code where necessary.
