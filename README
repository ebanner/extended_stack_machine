This project entails me, Edward Banner, porting a stack-based machine emulator
from C++ to Java and building a GUI front end that will allow the user to
visually interact with a program during execution.  I'm none too familiar with
porting, so this will most likely be an entire rewrite of one Dr. Timothy V.
Fossum's code.  That being said, I will employ Dr. Fossum's techniques in my
code where necessary.
