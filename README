This project entails me, Edward Banner, porting a stack-based machine emulator
from C++ to Java.  I'm none too familiar with porting, so this will most likely
be an entire rewrite of one Dr. Timothy V. Fossum's code.  This is not to say I
will not take Dr. Fossum's code as inspiration--quite the contrary in fact.

Along with implementing Dr. Fossum's stack-based machine emulator in Java,
there will also be a GUI frontend built on top of it.

So let's get started!
