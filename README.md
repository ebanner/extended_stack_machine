eXtended Stack Machine
======================

The eXtended Stack Machine is a simplified CPU architecture created by Timothy
V. Fossum for educational purposes. For more information about the eXtended
Stack Machine, visit Dr. Fossum's man page in the doc/ directory of this
project.

Provided here is a working implemention of the eXtended Stack Machine with a GUI
front end built with the Java Swing library to provide students with the ability
to step through and examine a running program.
