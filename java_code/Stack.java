/* This class represents a stack, although stack purists will disagree.  Let me
 * explain:  A true stack is a data structure in which it is only possible to
 * push and pop values.  This stack supports pushing and popping, but also
 * allows the user to access the stack pointer (SP) value, along with providing
 * the user the ability to insert values wherever they would like
 * (through the putContents() method).  The user is also free to grab values from
 * anywhere on the stack (through the getContents() method).  These methods made
 * implementing the Stack Machine Emulator far easier. This stack class also
 * provides a reveal() method, in which each element in the stack is printed
 * alongside its location.  The stack grows downward, with the top location
 * identified as position `height-1' and the bottom position `0'.*/
